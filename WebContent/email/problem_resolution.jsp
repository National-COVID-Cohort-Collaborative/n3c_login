<p>Dear N3C Researcher:</p>

<p>Thank you for your submission. We are having issues affiliating your registration with an institution.
This could be because your institution has not yet executed a Data Use Agreement with NCATS. You can

<p>If your institution does have an executed DUA,
please allow 1-3 business days for us to assess the issue. You will receive an email on how to proceed.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
The N3C Team</p>
