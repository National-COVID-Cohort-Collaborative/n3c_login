<p>Dear N3C Researcher:</p>

<p>Thank you for your submission. It appears that you or your organization do not have an executed N3C Data Use Agreement (DUA) on file.</p>

<p>Before you can proceed, a DUA must be signed between your organization and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS).
If your authorized signing official has not already obtained a copy of the DUA, it can be accessed on the NCATS N3C webpage.
Once the DUA has been executed, you will receive an email with a link and information to access your account.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
The N3C Team</p>
