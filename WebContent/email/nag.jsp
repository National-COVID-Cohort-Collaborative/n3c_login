Subject: N3C Data Enclave Palantir Training Account Registration Instructions
 
Dear N3C members:
 
We are excited to begin research in the N3C Data Enclave for COVID-19!
 
As a reminder, please note: N3C members who previously had accounts for accessing Palantir training will have to re-register for a new N3C Data Enclave account to be able to submit a Data Use Request (DUR) form and gain access to the data. An executed Data Use Agreement (DUA) is required before you can register and gain access to the data. 
 
Once you - or your institution - have completed the DUA, please go to the N3C Data Enclave Access web page on the N3C website and follow the steps for “First Time Users.”  On the Registration form, select the option for “N3C Enclave Access.” (This was not previously available to you with your original training account.)
 
Please allow 48 hours to receive account notification. Once account notification has been received, you should be able to submit a Data Use Request (DUR) form.
 
Thank you for your collaboration in this important endeavor.
 
Sincerely,
The National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)
